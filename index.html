	<h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
	
         <p>With over 20 years of culinary experience both in a hospitality setting and as a private chef, my menus showcase 
			my diverse background of food preparation.</p>
         <p>After graduating from Le Cordon Bleu, I continued to sharpen my culinary skills with some stapled hospitality 
			food and beverage restaurants and hotels, including China Grill, Hard Rock Hotel, and Hilton.</p>
		<p>With an appreciation to the entire food and beverage experience, I've curated many of my dishes with cocktails that satisfies the pallet perfectly.</p>

	<p> In the warm bustle of the kitchen, Chef Scott gathers his cooks around the stainless-steel prep table
	for their weekly innovation meeting. The aroma of herbs, simmering stocks, and freshly baked bread fills the 
	air as he encourages each team member to share ideas, experiment with ingredients, and challenge traditional 
	techniques. With a collaborative spirit and a passion for creativity, the group tastes, tests, and refines new 
	dishes—blending classic culinary foundations with bold, modern twists. The meeting becomes a space where 
	inspiration flows freely, where mistakes spark breakthroughs, and where every cook’s voice contributes to 
	shaping the next evolution of the menu. Together, they transform the kitchen into a workshop of imagination, 
	fueling a culture of innovation that keeps their cuisine fresh, exciting, and unforgettable.</p>

	<p>During the tasting menu experience, Chef Scott presents each dish with care and confidence, serving up pure 
	deliciousness to the client. Every course arrives as a small, flavorful journey—beautifully plated, thoughtfully
	crafted, and introduced with a brief story of its inspiration and ingredients. The chef watches eagerly 
	as the client takes the first bite, hoping to capture that subtle moment of delight when flavors connect and the 
	dish speaks for itself. With each plate, he aims to deliver not just food, but an immersive culinary experience 
	that showcases creativity, skill, and passion. The tasting becomes a shared celebration of taste, artistry, and 
	the joy of bringing exceptional food to the table.</p>

	<p>Chef Scott and his team gather after a tasting consultation, where he works closely with his team to craft a seamless culinary 
	experience for their client. Each dish is carefully prepared, presented, and tasted, with the team exchanging
	feedback, adjusting flavors, and refining presentations in real time. Collaboration is at the heart of the 
	process—chefs, cooks, and servers coordinate to ensure that every detail, from seasoning to plating to pacing,
	exceeds expectations. The consultation is more than just tasting food; it’s a dynamic conversation between the 
	kitchen and the client, where creativity, precision, and teamwork come together to shape a menu that is both 
	memorable and perfectly tailored.</p>
